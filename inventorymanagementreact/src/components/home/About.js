                    <p>A company's inventory is one of its most valuable assets. In retail, manufacturing, food service and other inventory-intensive sectors, a company's inputs and finished products are the core of its business. A shortage of inventory when and where it's needed can be extremely detrimental.</p>
                    {/* <p>At the same time, inventory can be thought of as a liability if not in an accounting sense. A large inventory carries the risk of spoilage, theft, damage or shifts in demand. Inventory must be insured, and if it is not sold in time it may have to be disposed of at clearance pricesâ€”or simply destroyed.</p> */}
